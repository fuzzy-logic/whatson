It came to be known as &quot;Black Wall Street&quot;. Segregation laws virtually forced the community to be self sufficient. The neighborhood was destroyed by the Tulsa race riot in 1921. However, it was rebuilt thereafter and thrived for years. The documentary spotlights how Black Wall Street is a template for black economic development and empowerment. Can it be applied today?
